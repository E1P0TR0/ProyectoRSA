Today, we have all gathered here for a special occasion. Before starting the occasion, I would first like to welcome our respected Boss. Today is the day we have to bid farewell to our respected Boss, our mentor, our guide. I have been working in this company for almost 15 years now, and it is only because of you, Sir, that I could make it till here. I am sure everyone present here will agree that working here with all the pressure and workload became easy because of our Boss.Sir, today you retire from your job, but you will remain in our hearts forever. From tomorrow everyone will feel your absence in this office and will miss your morning greetings. It saddens us to bid you goodbye, but let us make your last working day a happy one.Sir, you have guided us throughout, you have switched roles from being our Boss to being our friend and making sure that we were appropriately guided. Your way of handling impromptu meetings, to abrupt presentations, has amazed all of us. If we can achieve even one-tenth of your skills of management, we will consider ourselves lucky.
